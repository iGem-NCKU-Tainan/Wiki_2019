We taught them some tips on how to compete in this competition and how to meet the medal criteria.</li>
                                <li>We were also mentored by the 2019 iGEM UNSW Team on how to create a business plan. They provided us with their global business scaffold and advised us on how to sell our products by first setting up a business model. We also discussed the pharmaceutical industry in both Taiwan and Australia as well as the laws and regulations regarding the sales and usage of medication.</li>

                                <li>Human practices play a big role in how we spread our ideas beyond the laboratory. To put synthetic biology in layman terms, we concluded that learning through games will achieve the greatest effect. Hence, we developed our own snake game to raise awareness of the public towards uremic toxins. For this time, the highlight of our human practices is the Oh My Gut Escape Room, where we hosted a number of student teams from NCKU and taught them about the dangers of p-Cresol while having fun.

We reached out to the TFDA (Taiwan Food and Drugs Administration), healthcare professionals and engineering professors, wherewith their suggestion, we developed and optimized the design of our CreSolve living therapeutic drug as well as our CreSense sensing device. We also visited several therapeutic companies where they helped us further develop our plans for marketing and start-up to make our products closer to reality</li>

                                <li>Tyrosine ammonia-lyase (TAL) is an enzyme responsible for the conversion of tyrosine to p-Coumaric acid. To increase the expression of TAL, we decided to place the J23100 promoter and B0034 RBS upstream of the TAL coding gene. As such, the <a href="https://2019.igem.org/Team:NCKU_Tainan/Improve" target="_blank">improvement</a> will align with our aim to further reduce the level of p-Cresol via diverting the tyrosine metabolism pathway.</li>
